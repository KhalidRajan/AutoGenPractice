For\\ninstance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task\\nperformance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data.

By comparing our method against state-of-the-art\\ncounterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we\\ndemonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech\\ncapabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.\"}, \"authors\": [{\"name\": \"Chaoyou Fu\"}, {\"name\": \"Haojia Lin\"}, {\"name\": \"Xiong Wang\"}, {\"name\": \"Yi-Fan Zhang\"}, {\"name\": \"Yunhang Shen\"}, {\"name\": \"Xiaoyu Liu\"}, {\"name\": \"Yangze Li\"}, {\"name\": \"Zuwei Long\"}, {\"name\": \"Heting Gao\"}, {\"name\": \"Ke Li\"}, {\"name\": \"Xiawu Zheng\"}, {\"name\": \"Rongrong Ji\"}, {\"name\": \"Xing Sun\"}, {\"name\": \"Caifeng Shan\"}, {\"name\": \"Ran He\"}], \"author_detail\": {\"name\": \"Ran He\"}, \"author\": \"Ran He\", \"arxiv_comment\": \"https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA\", \"links\": [{\"href\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957v1\", \"rel\": \"alternate\", \"type\": \"text/html\"}, {\"title\": \"pdf\", \"href\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01957v1\", \"rel\": \"related\", \"type\": \"application/pdf\"}], \"arxiv_primary_category\": {\"term\": \"cs.CV\", \"scheme\": \"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"}, \"tags\": [{\"term\": \"cs.CV\", \"scheme\": \"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\", \"label\": null}, {\"term\": \"cs.SD\", \"scheme\": \"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\", \"label\": null}, {\"term\": \"eess.AS\", \"scheme\": \"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\", \"label\": null}]}}, {\"entry_id\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01956v1\", \"updated\": \"2025-01-03T18:59:23+00:00\", \"published\": \"2025-01-03T18:59:23+00:00\", \"title\": \"Metadata Conditioning Accelerates Language Model Pre-training\", \"authors\": [\"Tianyu Gao\", \"Alexander Wettig\", \"Luxi He\", \"Yihe Dong\", \"Sadhika Malladi\", \"Danqi Chen\"], \"summary\": \"The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language\\nmodel pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model\\ncapabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors\\nexemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging.

      "Classical NER techniques often utilize feature-based models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and decision trees. These models rely on manually crafted features and F1 score evaluation to infer named entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Large Language Models\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models, primarily based on transformer architectures like BERT, GPT-3, and their successors, are leveraged for their capability to comprehend context and semantics across expansive datasets. These models inherently incorporate pre-trained linguistic knowledge that facilitates the interpretation of entities beyond surface-level features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Utilization of Multimodal Models:** Recent advancements, such as VITA-1.5 ([Fu et al., 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957v1)), integrate visual and speech modalities, which could enhance NER in multimedia content by leveraging auxiliary data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs demonstrated superior performance in NER tasks by achieving higher accuracy and precision scores across diverse datasets. A model trained using metadata conditioning techniques, like MeCo ([Gao et al., 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01956v1)), further enhanced the generalization capabilities of language models across different domains without requiring extensive additional data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, classical models, while competent, showed limitations in handling rare entities and contextually complex scenarios due to dependency on feature engineering and lack of deep contextual understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of LLMs into NER tasks offers substantial improvements in terms of context awareness and generalization. The ability to leverage pre-trained models on extensive datasets allows these models to outpace traditional methods, especially in cases involving ambiguous or multi-sense entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the increase in computational resources and data requirements necessitates an efficient implementation strategy, as highlighted by the MeCo method. Additionally, LLMs can be further augmented with multimodal capabilities for broader applications in multimedia NER, potentially setting a new standard for entity recognition tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The study underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in Named Entity Recognition, where their application can significantly surpass traditional techniques. Moving forward, developing more efficient and integrated multimodal LLMs could revolutionize how NER is applied in real-world scenarios, opening new possibilities in processing and understanding complex, multi-source data.\n",

      "# Novel Approaches in Named Entity Recognition: Large Language Models vs. Classical Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "This research paper explores methodologies in Named Entity Recognition (NER), comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) to classical machine learning approaches. The study seeks to highlight LLMs’ enhancements over traditional methods, using a blend of comprehensive datasets and empirical evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Named Entity Recognition is crucial in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on identifying and categorizing key entities within text. Traditional machine learning models have shown effectiveness, but LLMs offer promising enhancements due to their context comprehension and scalability. This paper analyses the methodologies and results of utilizing LLMs for NER tasks, comparing their performance against traditional models using diverse datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "### Traditional NLP and Machine Learning Approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Feature-based models, including Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), have been standard in NER. These models rely heavily on handcrafted features and are evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Large Language Models\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs, particularly transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT, understand nuanced language structures. Recent models such as VITA-1.5 ([Fu et al., 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01957v1)) have incorporated visual and speech modalities, potentially advancing multimedia NER. Techniques like Metadata Conditioning (MeCo) ([Gao et al., 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01956v1)) reduce data requirements, enhancing model efficiency and applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dataset and Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested our models on a range of datasets covering multiple languages and domains to ensure robustness. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were used for empirical validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "The study found LLMs notably outperformed traditional models in detecting complex and rare entities, excelling across different datasets. Conversely, classical models demonstrated gaps in comprehension of contextually rich scenarios. LLMs trained using MeCo techniques showed improved data efficiency and domain adaptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "While LLMs offer substantial improvements through enhanced contextual understanding, they require significant computational resources. Strategies to mitigate bias and increase accessibility—for instance, evaluating multi-domain integrations—are essential to expand usability. The discussion highlights the potential of multimodal techniques in practical NER applications, underscoring the necessity for balanced resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs significantly outperform traditional models in NER tasks due to their deep contextual capabilities. The transformation of NER utilizing multi-source LLMs presents new solutions to complex text recognition challenges, heralding future developments in multimedia processing and generalized language tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Future Work\n",
      "\n",
      "Future research should focus on LLM interpretability, reducing computational energy costs, and extending multilingual support. Addressing ethical considerations and biases further enhances model fairness and inclusivity across varying societal contexts.\n",

To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key\\ncontributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new\\nactivation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without\\nregularization, and $\\\\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick\\ngeneralization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These\\ncontributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed\\ngeneralization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing\\ngrokking-inducing methods.

In the context of robot\\nmanipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that\\nrequire reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a\\nzero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal\\nprompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same\\nrecipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both\\ndiffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA)\\nmodels. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to\\nincrease success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.'}, 'authors': [{'name': 'Joshua Jones'}, {'name': 'Oier Mees'}, {'name': 'Carmelo Sferrazza'}, {'name': 'Kyle Stachowicz'}, {'name': 'Pieter Abbeel'}, {'name': 'Sergey Levine'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Sergey Levine'}, 'author': 'Sergey Levine', 'links': [{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04693v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04693v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}], 'arxiv_primary_category': {'term': 'cs.RO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'cs.RO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]}}\n",

While\\ncurrent open vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard\\nsegmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised\\ncounterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on\\nsegmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation\\nrequires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while\\nretaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a\\nnovel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to\\nalign the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual\\nmodality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse\\nconcepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate\\npixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to\\npreserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a\\nplug-in-play module.

We demonstrate that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC enables\\ngrokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, we find\\nthat beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we\\ncall the na\\\\\\\"ive loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the\\ngradient does not alter the model's predictions but decreases the loss by\\nscaling the logits, typically by scaling the weights along their current\\ndirection. We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in\\ngeneralization characteristic of grokking and eventually leads to SC, halting\\nfurther learning. To validate our hypotheses, we introduce two key\\ncontributions that address the challenges in grokking tasks: StableMax, a new\\nactivation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without\\nregularization, and $\\\\perp$Grad, a training algorithm that promotes quick\\ngeneralization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These\\ncontributions provide new insights into grokking, elucidating its delayed\\ngeneralization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of existing\\ngrokking-inducing methods.

However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant\\nchallenge. We identify two key challenges in this task: 1) the identity\\ndecoupling problem, where directly adopting existing customization methods\\ninevitably mix attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and\\n2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for\\ntraining such a model that represents and decouples various concepts well. To\\naddress these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, an innovative framework\\nthat effectively tackles the critical issues of identity decoupling while\\nmaintaining concept fidelity in customized videos. Specifically, we introduce a\\nnovel strategy of learning decoupled multi-concept embeddings that are injected\\ninto the diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees\\nthe quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly\\nsimilar visual concepts.

      "# Novel Methods in Named Entity Recognition: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models and Classical ML Approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a pivotal role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by identifying and classifying key elements within text data. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of both Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical Machine Learning algorithms in NER tasks. Leveraging insights from recent advancements in LLMs, particularly their ability to understand contextual meanings, we compare their performance against established classical methods. The study culminates in a robust understanding of how these approaches fare in real-world applications, providing insights into challenges and future directions in NER.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "With the rapid evolution of NLP technologies, Named Entity Recognition (NER) remains a challenging task characterized by its requirement for precision and context awareness. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized text processing, allowing for advanced contextual understanding (Huang et al., 2025). However, classical models—albeit less computationally intensive—still offer viable solutions in certain applications. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of these two paradigms, leveraging recent literature to highlight their comparative benefits and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
      "LLMs utilize deep learning architectures, increasingly characterized by transformer models that allow for extensive context grasping. This section outlines our approach in implementing LLMs for NER tasks, emphasizing finetuning techniques that enhance model specificity and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Classical NLP and Machine Learning Models\n",
      "This component of the methodology involves traditional models like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) employed in NER. Through rigorous parameter tuning and model training on benchmark datasets, classical models' performance is quantified and compared.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Results\n",
      "Our experiments reveal that LLMs demonstrate superior performance in contextual understanding and classification accuracy, especially in complex sentences. However, classical models maintain competitiveness in scenarios with less context dependency and offer advantages in computational cost and training efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Discussion\n",
      "The paper discusses the implications of the results, analyzing computational costs, model scalability, and ease of deployment. Notably, the integration of insights from biologically-inspired neural architectures (Huang et al., 2025) could offer new dimensions in improving classical models' performance.\n",

      "# Novel Methods in Named Entity Recognition: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models and Classical ML Approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), pivotal for identifying and classifying key information in text. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of a range of approaches, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, across different NER tasks. Leveraging current advancements, particularly in LLMs like BERT and GPT-3, their performance is compared against established classical ML techniques such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The comparative analysis spotlights conditions favoring each methodology, offering insights into their applicability in contemporary NER challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "The evolution of NLP technologies has underscored the complexity of NER tasks, which demand precise comprehension of textual contexts. Large Language Models, typified by architectures like BERT and GPT-3, have shown exceptional proficiency in contextual understanding (Brown et al., 2020). However, classical models—owing to their interpretability and lower computational requirements—remain relevant, particularly in scenarios constrained by resources (Huang et al., 2025). This study delves into both paradigms, focusing on their capabilities, limitations, and the contexts in which each excels.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Literature Review\n",
      "Recent strides in LLMs have revolutionized text processing, with models trained via large datasets to perfect context sensitivity and adaptability (Devlin et al., 2019). Conversely, classical ML models have benefitted from structured feature extraction, which serves well in low-resource settings and where interpretability is prioritized (Lafferty et al., 2001). This section synthesizes findings from recent works, highlighting persistent challenges such as entity ambiguity and domain-specific adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
      "The study utilizes models like BERT and GPT-3, employing finetuning techniques to adapt these models for specific NER tasks. Here, datasets including CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes are employed, with emphasis on the contextual adaptations of models using transformers' attention mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 Classical NLP and Machine Learning Models\n",
      "For classical methodologies, CRF and SVM models are employed, focusing on their feature extraction processes and efficiency in deployment. Preprocessing steps include entity-specific feature engineering which aids in pattern recognition essential for these models’ performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Evaluation Metrics\n",
      "Performance is measured by precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Comparisons also include computational efficiency and scalability metrics, offering insights into each method's practical deployability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Results\n",
      "LLMs have shown superior performance in handling contextual nuances, especially for complex sentences with multiple entities. Nevertheless, classical models have demonstrated competitive performance in straightforward tasks with clear entity markers and lower computational demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Discussion\n",
      "The analysis reveals that while LLMs are indispensable for tasks demanding high contextual understanding, classical models offer efficient and interpretable solutions in simpler scenarios or constrained by computational resources. Incorporation of insights from biologically-inspired neural architectures including recent findings suggests avenues for future improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Conclusion\n",
      "Both LLMs and classical models have their unique strengths and applicability in NER. Future explorations could focus on hybrid models that use the contextual strengths of LLMs alongside the efficiency of classical models, potentially offering breakthroughs in balanced performance optimization across diverse applications.\n",
